# John Mayer Fan Site Project

This is my implementation for the [Odin Project's final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart), creating a fake shopping page.

The main functionality has been implemented which includes viewing, adding and removing albums to a shopping cart page.

A daily song is also provided via the Spotify API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is viewable via GitHub Pages [here](https://jluong23.github.io/shopping-cart-project/).
